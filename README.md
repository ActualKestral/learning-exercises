This is am enviroment for me to learn how github and project structures work.

For the most part this repo will be private, appart from sharing with a few individuals who can check my work 
and help push me in the right direction.

How to do a commit.        
first create the branch you want to commit to
git checkout -b branch-name
the add the files you want to commit
git add.
then make your commit
git commit -m "message"
then push the commit to your new branch
git push -u origin branch-name
then you can make a pull request from your branch to master on the github website
